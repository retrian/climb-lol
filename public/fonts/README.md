Place custom webfont files for the app in this folder.

Recommended formats (best browser support/performance):
- .woff2 (preferred)
- .woff (optional fallback)

Example file names:
- BeaufortForLOL-Regular.woff2
- BeaufortForLOL-Semibold.woff2

These files are served from `/fonts/...` in Next.js because this folder is under `public/`.
